# Hey There 
I currently work at Cloudflight.io as a software engineer. I started there after I finished a Higher technical college for computer science in 2020. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Dart, C#, Go and Flutter. I am looking forward to bring some cool things to the amazing OSS world.
